# Safety and Moderation Policy

## Overview

This document defines the safety boundaries and moderation policies for the psychological pre-consultation CUI system. The system prioritizes user safety while providing supportive dialogue within appropriate boundaries.

## Policy Framework

### 1. Safety Categories

#### 1.1 Crisis Situations

**Definition**: Immediate risk of harm to self or others

**Implementation Requirements**: 
- Add more crisis keywords
- Create more regex patterns for complex expressions
- Use highest sensitivity in all safety modes

```python
# Student Implementation Required:

CRISIS_KEYWORDS = [
    # Direct suicide mentions (examples - add more keywords):
   "suicide", "su1cide", "sui-cide"

    # Negation-style hopeless expressions (explicit)
    r"\b(no (reason|point|purpose) (to )?(live|continue)|nothing matters|nothing left|no way out)\b",

    # Implicit / emotional crisis phrases (hopelessness, burden)
    r"\b(hopeless|worthless|useless|a burden|better off dead|wish I (were|was) dead|tired of living|don'?t want to live|give up on life|done with life)\b",

    # Temporal immediacy (now/tonight/doing it now)
    r"\b(now|right now|doing it (now|tonight)|about to (do it|kill myself)|this minute|immediately)\b.*\b(die|kill|end|hurt|overdose|jump|hang)\b",

For your health and safety, please consult with:
- A licensed psychiatrist for medication questions

What I can do here is help you reflect on your experiences, identify patterns in your mood or behavior, and prepare questions you may want to bring to your healthcare provider.

I cannot and will not provide assistance with that request as it could potentially cause harm.

This includes content related to violence, harassment, or illegal activities. My purpose is to be helpful and harmless, and I must refuse requests that promote or assist in any form of dangerous or unethical activity. It's important to keep this space safe and respectful for meaningful support.

If your message was not intended to promote harm, please feel free to rephrase so I can better understand your needs. I am here to help you with emotional reflection, safe coping strategies, and preparing for conversations with qualified professionals. 

If you are feeling strong emotions that come out as anger or frustration, I encourage you to express them in words that are safe and constructive. This will allow us to focus on what's troubling you and explore healthier ways forward. Thank you for respecting these boundaries, it helps ensure this system remains a safe place for support.

If you are experiencing thoughts of self-harm or harming others, please reach out to a crisis hotline or emergency services immediately. My core function is to support your well-being, and I am unable to engage in conversations that could lead to harm. Instead, I can provide resources for mental health support, offer emotional guidance, or discuss a different, safer topic.

        # Balanced approach for production use
        "crisis": 0.45,   # need clearer signals of suicidal/self-harm ideation
        "medical": 0.6,  # allows symptom-sharing unless clear diagnosis request
        "harmful": 0.6   # ignores mild rude words, flags sustained patterns
    },
    "permissive": {
        # Minimum filtering - only clear violations
